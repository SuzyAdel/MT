## 🔥 What Went Well?  
Through trial and (lots of) error, I learned a few key things:  

✅ **Regularization is a lifesaver** – Dropout, L2 weight decay, and even Gaussian noise helped prevent overfitting.  
✅ **Dynamic Learning Rates > Static LR** – Using ReduceLROnPlateau & LearningRateScheduler made a big difference.  
✅ **Less is more** – Reducing LSTM units actually improved stability.  
✅ **Batch size matters** – 64 was too much, 32 worked better.

## 🔄 Evolution of the Model  

### 🏁 **1st Approach – Basic Seq2Seq (Worked, but Overfit)**  
- Standard encoder-decoder  
- Static learning rate (0.0005)  
- Batch size: **64**  

### ✨ **2nd Approach – Adding Regularization**  
- Dropout (**0.3–0.5**)  
- L2 weight regularization  
- Dynamic Learning Rate (**ReduceLROnPlateau**)  
- Batch size: **32**  

### ⚡ **3rd Approach – Recurrent Dropout & Gradient Clipping**  
- **Recurrent dropout** for better generalization  
- **L2 regularization**  
- **Reduced LSTM units** (less is more!)  
- **Gradient clipping** to prevent exploding gradients  

### 🔥 **4th Approach – Final Touches**  
- **Even fewer LSTM units** (cut it again!)  
- Stronger **L2 regularization**  
- Dropout **after embeddings**  
- **Gaussian noise** for extra regularization  
- **Early stopping** with more patience

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

📌 **Move to Transformers (properly)** – RNNs are great, but let's be honest, Transformers are better.  
📌 **Larger, more diverse dataset** – More data = better generalization.  
📌 **Pre-trained embeddings** – Could boost performance on rare words.  
📌 **Better inference & deployment** – No point in training if no one can use it!  

💡 **Lesson learned:** Sometimes, fewer LSTM units and better regularization beat just “making it bigger.” Also, debugging deep learning models is just a fancier form of suffering. 😆
